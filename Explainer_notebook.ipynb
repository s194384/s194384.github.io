    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen two datasets for this project. They can both be downloaded from [the city of Melbourne opendata](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/). The data comes from different kind of sensors located at Argyle Square, which is a small park located in Melbourne Australia. \n",
    "\n",
    "One dataset is the [blix-visits](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/blix-visits/information/?sort=datetime) which is a [pedestrian sensor](https://hdp-au-prod-app-com-participate-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/9616/5180/4859/Data_in_the_park_Argyle_Square_map.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and counts WiFi devices in a range of 30m radius from its location. \n",
    "The other is the [benches usage data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/guppy/information/?disjunctive.dev_id). There are two benches located at the park which are provided each with two [bench movement sensors](https://hdp-au-prod-app-com-participate-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/9616/5180/4859/Data_in_the_park_Argyle_Square_map.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) which detects when people sit on the bench. These sensors also measure the temperature when the bench is at use. \n",
    "\n",
    "I choose to work with these two datasets because they acquire some very specific data about people behavior at a park. The two datasets would also work well together since I could explore not only how many people are at the park but also how many uses the park to hang out in. I also found it very interesting to figure out why there was so much data for this specific small park. I found out the park was chosen to be a [smart park](https://participate.melbourne.vic.gov.au/emerging-tech-testbed/data-park) and there are actually a lot more data and sensors to explore in this small park.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal for the end user’s experience is to have found the data explored interesting. I hope to draw peoples attention to this small culture park in Melbourne. It would be awesome if one thought “Wow, I didn’t know observations pattens from such a small place could tell so much about the people using the park”. I also hope the interactive plot invites the reader to explore further and maybe discover other pattens in the data which hasn’t been mentioned.\n"
