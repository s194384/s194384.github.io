    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen two datasets for this project. They can both be downloaded from [the city of Melbourne opendata](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/). The data comes from different kind of sensors located at Argyle Square, which is a small park located in Melbourne Australia. \n",
    "\n",
    "One dataset is the [blix-visits](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/blix-visits/information/?sort=datetime) which is a [pedestrian sensor](https://hdp-au-prod-app-com-participate-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/9616/5180/4859/Data_in_the_park_Argyle_Square_map.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and counts WiFi devices in a range of 30m radius from its location. \n",
    "The other is the [benches usage data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/guppy/information/?disjunctive.dev_id). There are two benches located at the park which are provided each with two [bench movement sensors](https://hdp-au-prod-app-com-participate-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/9616/5180/4859/Data_in_the_park_Argyle_Square_map.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) which detects when people sit on the bench. These sensors also measure the temperature when the bench is at use. \n",
    "\n",
    "I choose to work with these two datasets because they acquire some very specific data about people behavior at a park. The two datasets would also work well together since I could explore not only how many people are at the park but also how many uses the park to hang out in. I also found it very interesting to figure out why there was so much data for this specific small park. I found out the park was chosen to be a [smart park](https://participate.melbourne.vic.gov.au/emerging-tech-testbed/data-park) and there are actually a lot more data and sensors to explore in this small park.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal for the end user’s experience is to have found the data explored interesting. I hope to draw peoples attention to this small culture park in Melbourne. It would be awesome if one thought “Wow, I didn’t know observations pattens from such a small place could tell so much about the people using the park”. I also hope the interactive plot invites the reader to explore further and maybe discover other pattens in the data which hasn’t been mentioned.\n"

    "# Genre\n",

    "The magazine style was chosen for the website. This way the reader is guided through the story which is being told from start to finish. A consistent visual platform was therefore used for the visual structure to emphasize the guidance for the reader. \n",
    "\n",
    "A close-up and zooming were used as tools for highlighting. The close-up was used on figure 4 for visual narrative so the reader more clearly could notice a difference in visitors across the days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition guidance wasn’t really used for this data story telling with is quite commend for the magazine style genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "A linear ordering was used for the narrative structure which again corresponds to the guidance of the reader. \n",
    "\n",
    "For interactivity hover highlighting/details and filtering/selection along with explicit instructions were tools used to engage in the story of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, captions/headlines, introductory text and summary were used to give the message across to the reader. Especially an introduction was used to start the reader of and then a summary at the finish to sum up everything the reader had learned along the way. It corresponds well with the guidance of the reader."
