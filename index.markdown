Argyle Square is a small park located in the center of Melbourne, Australia only walking distance from Melbourne Museum. With itâ€™s about 17.250 $\text{m}^2$ it is home to some local Italian atmosphere according to [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255100-d11883026-Reviews-Argyle_Square-Melbourne_Victoria.html).
To dive more into when people stay at this culture park the [blix-visits](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/blix-visits/information/?sort=datetime) dataset and [benches usage data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/guppy/information/?disjunctive.dev_id) dataset from [the city of Melbourne opendata](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/) have been used. The blix data counts the number of phones. The bench data monitors when people use two benches at the park and the temperature.
